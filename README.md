# GradUp

This App, which is made for patients with anorexia nervosa, is part of my Bachelor-Thesis and a continuation of the earlier project during the FS 2018/2019. GradUp has two major aspects: One is the motivation/support of patients with the goal to gain weight and the other is to collect clinical data with the bodysensor «Biovotion Everion» and also other study relevant data from user input in order to find out more about this disease. For a start, it should be investigated in a pilot study, if this sensor and GradUp work with AN patients. If it is suitable, then it could be investigated later on in a clinical trial, what the correlations are between the collected data and anorexia nervosa.

The goal of this project concerning the App GradUp is 1) to improve the App and add new (motivation/support-)functionalities and 2) process all study relevant data and provide it to the MIDATA platform.
