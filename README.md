# GradUp

This App, which is made for patients with anorexia nervosa, is part of my Bachelor-Thesis and a continuation of the earlier project during the FS 2018/2019. GradUp has two major aspects: One is the motivation of patients with the goal to gain weight and the other is to collect clinical data with the bodysensor «Biovotion Everion» and also other study relevant data with user input for a clinical trial to find out correlations between the collected data and anorexia nervosa.

The goal of this project concerning the App GradUp is 1) to improve the App and add new (motivation-)functionalities and 2) process all study relevant data and provide it to the MIDATA platform.
